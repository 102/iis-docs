# IHttpTokenKey::GetPasswordHash Method
Returns the user password as a hash value.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
virtual PCWSTR GetPasswordHash(  
   VOID  
) const = 0;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 This method takes no parameters.  
  
## Return Value  
 A pointer to a constant null-terminated Unicode string that contains the user password as a hash value.  
  
## Remarks  
 When a user logs on, the password is hashed into a null-terminated Unicode string based on a one-way hashing algorithm. This unique hash value may then be used for very fast lookups on users in the global token cache.  
  
## Notes for Implementers  
 [IHttpTokenKey](../../../webdevelopment-reference\native-code-api\webdev-native-api-reference/ihttptokenkey-interface.md) implementers are responsible for memory management with this data; therefore, `IHttpTokenKey` implementers that use dynamic memory allocation must release or call `delete` on the `PCWSTR` pointer when it is no longer needed.  
  
## Notes for Callers  
 `IHttpTokenKey` implementers are responsible for memory management with this data; therefore, `IHttpTokenKey` clients must not release or call `delete` on the returned `PCWSTR` pointer when this data is no longer needed. Furthermore, clients must not cast this data to a pointer that is not a `const` or change the state of the memory referenced by this `PCWSTR`; otherwise, an access violation will be thrown or the data will become invalid.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to create a global module that listens for [GL_CACHE_OPERATION](../../../webdevelopment-reference\native-code-api\webdev-native-api-reference/request-processing-constants.md) and [GL_CACHE_CLEANUP](../../../webdevelopment-reference\native-code-api\webdev-native-api-reference/request-processing-constants.md) events and then writes the `GetPasswordHash` information to the Event Viewer.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../wmi-provider/includes/iisver-md.md)] generates a large number of events in the Event Viewer. To avoid a log overflow error in a production environment, you should generally avoid writing cache information to the event log. For demonstration purposes, this code example writes an entry to the Event Viewer in debug mode only.  
  
<!-- TODO: review snippet reference  [!CODE [IHttpTokenKey#4](IHttpTokenKey#4)]  -->  
  
 The above code writes a new event to the Event Viewer, where the Data box contains XML that is similar to the following.  
  
```  
IHttpTokenKey::GetPasswordHash: 123456d1536d0b180399107b980bc6f82187d135799f92072b612156a4c14ec2  
```  
  
 Your module must export the [RegisterModule](../../../webdevelopment-reference\native-code-api\webdev-native-api-reference/pfn-registermodule-function.md) function. You can export this function by creating a module definition (.def) file for your project, or you can compile the module by using the `/EXPORT:RegisterModule` switch. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Request-Level HTTP Module By Using Native Code](../../../webdevelopment-reference\native-code-development-overview\native-code-dev-overview/walkthrough-creating-a-request-level-http-module-by-using-native-code.md).  
  
 You can optionally compile the code by using the `__stdcall (/Gz)` calling convention instead of explicitly declaring the calling convention for each function.
