# IHttpServer::IncrementThreadCount Method
Increments the thread count for the thread pool.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
virtual VOID IncrementThreadCount(  
   VOID  
) = 0;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 This method takes no parameters.  
  
## Return Value  
 `VOID`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `IncrementThreadCount` method increases count of available threads for the thread pool by a single thread. The count will not exceed the maximum limit for the thread pool of 256 threads.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  `IncrementThreadCount` does not actually increase the number of threads in use; only the thread count is affected.  
  
 When you are developing an HTTP module that performs operations that require a long time to process, your HTTP module could call `IncrementThreadCount` to increase the available threads for the thread pool while your module executes your long-running operations. When the module is finished, it would call [IIHttpServer::DecrementThreadCount](../../../webdevelopment-reference\native-code-api\webdev-native-api-reference/ihttpserver-decrementthreadcount-method.md) to restore the thread count.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to create an HTTP module that calls `IncrementThreadCount` to increase the thread count for the thread pool and then sleeps for 30 seconds. The module then calls `DecrementThreadCount` to restore the thread count and exits.  
  
<!-- TODO: review snippet reference  [!CODE [IHttpServerIncrementThreadCount#1](IHttpServerIncrementThreadCount#1)]  -->  
  
 Your module must export the [RegisterModule](../../../webdevelopment-reference\native-code-api\webdev-native-api-reference/pfn-registermodule-function.md) function. You can export this function by creating a module definition (.def) file for your project, or you can compile the module by using the `/EXPORT:RegisterModule` switch. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Request-Level HTTP Module By Using Native Code](../../../webdevelopment-reference\native-code-development-overview\native-code-dev-overview/walkthrough-creating-a-request-level-http-module-by-using-native-code.md).  
  
 You can optionally compile the code by using the `__stdcall (/Gz)` calling convention instead of explicitly declaring the calling convention for each function.
