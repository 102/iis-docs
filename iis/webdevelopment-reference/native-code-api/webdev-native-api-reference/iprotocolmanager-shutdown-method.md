# IProtocolManager::Shutdown Method
Shuts down a protocol manager.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
virtual HRESULT Shutdown(  
   IN BOOL fImmediate  
) = 0;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `fImmediate`  
 `true` to indicates that the shutdown should be immediate; otherwise, `false`.  
  
## Return Value  
 An `HRESULT`. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|Indicates that the operation was successful.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Shutdown` method is called by a worker process when it is shutting down; other applications should not call `Shutdown`. A worker process may have interdependent protocol managers, and calling the `Shutdown` method for a protocol manager may create a shutdown conflict. This can occur, for example, when a protocol manager cannot shut down because it depends on another protocol manager that is attempting to shut down. In turn, that second protocol manager cannot shut down due to a dependency on the original protocol manager that cannot shut down.
