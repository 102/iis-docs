The World's First IIS Live Smooth Streaming Event - A Video Case Study
====================
by [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft)

The French Open, organized by the French Tennis Federation, is one of the premier events in the professional tennis calendar, showcasing the best tennis talent in the world playing in the world renowned Roland Garros stadium. In 2008, the Open was broadcast in 198 countries to a global audience of millions. In 2009, France Télévisions wished to offer tennis fans in France an online high definition (HD) experience to complement the extensive coverage on its three broadcast channels (France 2, France 3 and France 4). France Télévisions chose to partner with Microsoft, Level 3 Communications, and Inlet Technologies to deliver the live event online in HD, using IIS Live Smooth Streaming and Microsoft Silverlight. This was the first live HD Smooth Streaming public event in the world, and generated amazing results, including an average 64 minutes of online viewing time per user, with over half of the users watching the 3 Mbps video stream and an average of 16,000 unique viewers per day! Watch the video case study now to learn how it was done!
